Advanced Development Mod Tools
==============================

GoldSrc map compiling tools that are based on Solokiller's [VHLT-clean](https://github.com/Solokiller/VHLT-clean/tree/remove-xash).   
ADMT is being developed for Advanced Development Mod. Currently, it supports large maps (size of which can be specified by the mapper) and a special tooltexture called [BOLIDHINT](https://twhl.info/thread/locate-post/343864).

Plans:

- clean up a good chunk of the code for maintenance
- add support for the mod's EEL system
- export OBJ meshes for physics
